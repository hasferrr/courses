## Game
Protect the Egg, in which the dragon fights some enemies that will destroy the Egg. This game has three-level that each level has a different difficulty. The level will be completed after the dragon kills all enemies and will lose when the egg breaks. There are some powerups to make the dragon stronger, but some of them are traps.

## Control
You can control the dragon with the keyboard (W to go up, S to go down, A to go left, D to go right, and SpaceBar to fire).
