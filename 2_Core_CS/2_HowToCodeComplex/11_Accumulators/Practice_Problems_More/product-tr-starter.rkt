; PROBLEM:
; 
; (A) Consider the following function that consumes a list of numbers and produces
;     the product of all the numbers in the list. Use the stepper to analyze the behavior 
;     of this function as the list gets larger and larger. 
;     
; (B) Use an accumulator to design a tail-recursive version of product.
; 


;; (listof Number) -> Number
;; produce product of all elements of lon
(check-expect (product empty) 1)
(check-expect (product (list 2 3 4)) 24)
#;
(define (product lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) 1]
        [else
         (* (first lon)
            (product (rest lon)))]))

(define (product lon0)
  ;; rsf is Number; result so far of products
  (local [(define (product lon rsf)
            (cond [(empty? lon) rsf]
                  [else
                   (product (rest lon)
                            (* rsf (first lon)))
                   ]))]
    (product lon0 1)))
