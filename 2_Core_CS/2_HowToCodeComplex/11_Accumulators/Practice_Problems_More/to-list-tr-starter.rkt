; PROBLEM:
; 
; Consider the following function that consumes Natural number n and produces a list of all
; the naturals of the form (list 1 2 ... n-1 n) not including 0.
;     
; Use an accumulator to design a tail-recursive version of to-list.

;; Natural -> (listof Natural) 
;; produce (cons n (cons n-1 ... empty)), not including 0
(check-expect (to-list 0) empty)
(check-expect (to-list 1) (list 1))
(check-expect (to-list 3) (list 1 2 3))
