; PROBLEM:
; 
; In the Harry Potter movies, it is very important which of the four houses a
; wizard is placed in when they are at Hogwarts. This is so important that in 
; most families multiple generations of wizards are all placed in the same family. 
; 
; Design a representation of wizard family trees that includes, for each wizard,
; their name, the house they were placed in at Hogwarts and their children. We
; encourage you to get real information for wizard families from: 
;    http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page
; 
; The reason we do this is that designing programs often involves collection
; domain information from a variety of sources and representing it in the program
; as constants of some form. So this problem illustrates a fairly common scenario.
; 
; That said, for reasons having to do entirely with making things fit on the
; screen in later videos, we are going to use the following wizard family tree,
; in which wizards and houses both have 1 letter names. (Sigh)

; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a wizard and produces the names of every 
; wizard in the tree that was placed in the same house as their immediate
; parent.

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a wizard and produces the number of wizards 
; in that tree (including the root). Your function should be tail recursive.

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a new function definition for same-house-as-parent that is tail 
; recursive. You will need a worklist accumulator.
