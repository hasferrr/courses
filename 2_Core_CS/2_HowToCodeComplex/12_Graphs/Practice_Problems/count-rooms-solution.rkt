; Using the following data definition, design a function that consumes a room and produces 
; the total number of rooms reachable from the given room. Include the starting room itself. 
; Your function should be tail recursive, but you should not use the primitive length function.
; 


;; Data Definitions: 

(define-struct room (name exits))
;; Room is (make-room String (listof Room))
;; interp. the room's name, and list of rooms that the exits lead to
