; PROBLEM:
; 
; Using the following data definition:
; 
; a) Design a function that consumes a room and produces a list of the names of all the rooms 
; reachable from that room.
; 
; b) Revise your function from (a) so that it produces a list of the rooms not the room names
; 


;; Data Definitions: 

(define-struct room (name exits))
;; Room is (make-room String (listof Room))
;; interp. the room's name, and list of rooms that the exits lead to
