- Give yourself **time** to get used to new languages and programming environments.
- It can be disorienting to learn a new tool, encounter unfamiliar error messages, etc.
- It can get frustrating if your only goal is to finish the homework as quickly as possible.
- Indeed, this strategy will probably be **counterproductive**: it will take you longer to finish the homework.
- Instead, enjoy "playing around" with examples and small programs as you start working on an assignment.

- If you approach the course by saying, ***"I will have fun learning to think in new ways,"*** then you will do well.
- If you instead say, "I will try to fit everything I see into the way I already look at programming," then you may get frustrated.
- By the end, the course material will **relate** back to what you know, but be patient.
