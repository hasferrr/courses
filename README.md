# Courses: Computer Science

## Summary

This is online computer science courses I took and am currently going through.

I mostly followed the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum that matches the curricular standards of the [CS 2013](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md): Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science.

The files in this repository mostly contain my solutions, materials, lecture notes, problem sets, quizzes, and the final project for each course.

> *taking computer science courses while in college (because I'm  currently studying Accounting in university (not CS, not IT)) is quite difficult because I have to divide my time between them, but I enjoy it.*
