## Introduction

This is online computer science courses I took and am currently going through. I mostly followed the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum. The files in this repository mostly contain my solutions to problem sets, quizzes, and the final project for each course that OSSU provides.

> *taking computer science courses while in college (because I'm  currently studying at a one university in Indonesia majoring in Accounting (not CS, not IT) is quite difficult because I have to divide my time between them, but I enjoy it.*
